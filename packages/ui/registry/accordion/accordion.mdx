# Accordion

An `Accordion` is a vertically stacked set of interactive item, which contain a title or content snippet representing a section of content. It hides a lot of content and rolls it up.
It consists of two children components: `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger` and `AccordionContent`, which are just wrapper components. You can pass any component as children to `AccordionItem` and `Accordion.Content`.
